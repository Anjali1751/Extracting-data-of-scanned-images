Developed a system using Flask and OpenCV libraries to extract data from scanned document images.
• Trained a machine learning model on a pre-labeled dataset to accurately identify and extract relevant data from images.
• Utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing, including noise reduction, thresholding, and contour detection to enhance data 
extraction accuracy.
• Deployed the system using Flask to create a user-friendly interface for uploading and processing scanned images.
• Achieved high accuracy in data extraction through iterative model training and optimization.
